# 8. "Unused" kernel constants are usually an unwired fast path

A registered-but-never-dispatched kernel still compiles a pipeline at every
`Gpu::new`, and usually means a model never learned about a faster sibling.
`crates/lfm` registered `flash_attn_bidir`, never dispatched it, and never
registered `flash_attn_bidir_split` - a drop-in at cosine 1.0 that measured
**~4×** at lfm's actual `head_dim 64` (1090 ms → 274 ms at T=8192).

Worse, the ledger's reason for not using flash - "measured ≈ naive here" - had
been measured against the *baseline* kernel, which is genuinely **0.3×**, i.e.
slower than the GEMM path. The conclusion never applied to the split kernel.
Before deleting an unused constant, check whether it is dead or merely unwired.
