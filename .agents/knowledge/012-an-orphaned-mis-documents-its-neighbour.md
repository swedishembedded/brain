# 12. An orphaned `///` mis-documents its neighbour

rustdoc concatenates a doc comment onto the **next item**, even across a blank
line. So a `///` left behind by a function that was deleted or hoisted does not
just sit there - it becomes the first paragraph of whatever follows.
`vision::blocks::Act` documented itself as "A single `Conv` unit. Supports
stride 1/2…"; `chronos2`'s `rmsnorm_bwd` carried the docs of the `rmsnorm` that
had been hoisted away from it. Four instances, all leftovers of the
one-implementation consolidations.

Clippy calls this `empty_line_after_doc_comments` and it is worth fixing rather
than silencing. The fix needs judgment: sometimes the doc belongs to the item
below and only the blank line is wrong, sometimes the doc is an orphan and must
go. An automated pass cannot tell the two apart.
