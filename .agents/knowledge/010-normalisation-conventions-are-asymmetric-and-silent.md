# 10. Normalisation conventions are asymmetric and silent

PuLID's `id_cond` is `ArcFace(raw) ‖ EvaClip(L2-normalised)` - the reference
reads insightface's `face_info['embedding']`, *not* `normed_embedding`, and
divides only the CLIP half. brain's `arcface` `embed` action normalises, because
its output is meant to be cosine-ready, so wiring it in is the natural move and
nothing structural catches it: same length, same dtype, same finite values, first
512 components ~20× too small. Verified numerically against the golden
(`‖id_cond[:512]‖ = 20.11`, `‖id_cond[512:]‖ = 1.0000`) before writing code.
