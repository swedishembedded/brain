# 2. Cosine is scale-invariant, so it cannot see a dropped scale factor

`got = 1.05 * want` scores cosine 1.0. A dropped `output_scale_factor`, a
doubled attention scale, or a mis-read GroupNorm gain all pass a cosine-only
ladder. Gate `rel_l2` (or `max_abs`) alongside it - `crates/unet`'s parity does,
after a reviewer noticed the ladder computed `rel_l2` at every stage and never
asserted it.
