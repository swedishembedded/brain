## Real bug: `kernel_timing` test hangs under a full `make test` run, not reproducible standalone

`crates/backend-vulkan/tests/kernel_timing.rs` (3 small tests - largest
buffer is 1024 f32 elements, largest dispatch count is 8) hung indefinitely
during a full `make test` run on this box: still running past 26 minutes,
one thread pinned at 100% CPU (consistent with a busy-poll `poll_wait()` on a
GPU fence that never signals) while `nvidia-smi` showed both P40s at 0%
utilization and near-zero memory - the GPU itself was not doing real work,
so this reads as a wedged wait, not a slow one. Killed manually (SIGKILL) to
unblock the gate; `make test`'s own 2400s timeout would eventually have
caught it too ("TIMED OUT ... almost certainly a deadlock").

**Not reproducible in isolation**: `cargo test -p brain-backend-vulkan --test
kernel_timing -- --test-threads=1` and the same with `--test-threads=8` both
pass cleanly in under a second, every time tried. The hang only showed up
inside the full `make test` invocation (`cargo test --lib --bins --tests`
across the whole workspace), which runs many test *binaries* - separate OS
processes - concurrently. This points at cross-process GPU contention (two
different test binaries opening/using the same physical Vulkan device at the
same time) rather than a bug in `kernel_timing.rs`'s own 3 tests or in
within-binary thread scheduling.

**A real lead, not yet chased down**: `kernel_times_also_works_on_the_
serialized_intel_workaround_path` calls `std::env::set_var("BRAIN_VK_SERIAL",
"1")` then `remove_var` later in the same test - `std::env::set_var` mutates
*process-global* state. Within this one binary that's provably safe (the
`--test-threads=8`/`=1` isolation runs above both passed), but if any other
GPU-touching code in the same process ever reads `BRAIN_VK_SERIAL` while this
test's env mutation is in flight, or if the actual mechanism serializing GPU
access across concurrent test *binaries* is weaker than the Makefile's "GPU
serialised" comment (`Makefile:191`) implies, a build-vs-run race here is
plausible. No file-lock or other cross-process GPU serialization mechanism
was found in the codebase during a search for one (`flock`/`gpu_lock`/
similar) - worth confirming whether one is expected to exist and is missing,
or whether concurrent GPU test binaries were never actually meant to be
mutually exclusive and this is a driver-level multi-process contention issue
instead.

**Practical impact**: `make test` is not currently reliable end-to-end on
this box without a lucky scheduling draw - a real gate-flakiness bug, not
just a slow test. Re-running the full suite after the first hang (with no
other GPU processes competing) passed cleanly, which is consistent with
contention rather than a deterministic defect in this test file itself.
