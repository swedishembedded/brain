# ouro

Scope: The Ouro looped language model (`crates/ouro`).

Brain's share of the looped-decoder work: Ouro reuses one 48-layer stack for
`total_ut_steps` passes per token, with per-pass attention history, an exit
gate and a pass-selected or exit-weighted head.

## Done

- Configuration and parameter layout pinned against the released
  `ByteDance/Ouro-2.6B-Thinking` header: 48 layers, hidden 2048, 16 query and
  16 KV heads of width 128, SwiGLU 5632, four passes, untied head, gated exit.
  The layout test checks 533 tensors and 2,667,974,657 parameters, so a shape
  drift fails before a 5 GiB import does.
- Hugging Face safetensors import (single file and sharded), whole-tensor
  rename with two-way coverage, no transpose.
- Forward graph: embedding applied once; each pass runs the shared stack,
  final RMSNorm and exit gate; the next pass consumes the previous pass's
  **normed** output (the reference reassigns `hidden_states = norm(...)`).
- Tiny reference parity (`tools/goldens/ouro_dump_reference.py`): every pass's
  hidden state, gate logit and head output match `modeling_ouro.py` at the
  same weights, CPU fp32, on the tiny shape.
- Exit rule: cumulative exit mass over the gate outputs, released threshold
  (1.0 selects the final pass).
- Incremental decode with one KV history per `(pass, layer)`: a step runs the
  new token through every pass, each appending its own K/V at the absolute
  position, and the gated result equals the full-sequence forward at every
  position and every pass on cpu, wgpu, native Vulkan and CUDA.
- Training objective and backward: every pass's CE weighted by that pass's exit
  probability, the gate's own gradient included (and zero on the final pass,
  whose probability is the remaining mass), accumulated into the one shared
  parameter set. The weighted loss matches the reference arithmetic recomputed
  from its own logits and gates; finite differences of the same forward pass
  on every parameter (the shared 2-layer stack visited three times) on cpu,
  wgpu, native Vulkan and CUDA.

## Left to do

- Real-checkpoint import and parity on a short prompt at fp32 (the tiny golden
  proves the math; the real weights prove the import).
- Serving: a `PagedDecoder` over the contiguous per-pass caches, admission
  reporting `passes × blocks_for`, a capability/action, residency, catalog row
  and CLI verb. Prefix reuse and host offload stay off for the looped path
  until they are pass-aware.
- LoRA fine-tuning: adapter sites on the shared stack's linears, with the
  frozen-base path (full-weight training allocates gradients and AdamW moments
  for every parameter and does not fit a 2.6B model on one card).
- Capability, residency, CLI verb, sample and the docs page (the arch row is
  deliberately absent until those exist).
- Threshold-selected decode across a batch whose rows exit on different
  passes.
